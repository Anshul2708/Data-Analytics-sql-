Traffic Congestion Analysis Using SQL & PostgreSQL

How can data-driven insights improve traffic flow in a residential society?

As part of my latest SQL project, I analyzed traffic patterns in a society to identify congestion trends and recommend data-backed solutions. Using PostgreSQL, I queried a dataset containing car movements, peak congestion hours, and daily trends.

Key Insights & Findings

    Morning Peak (7 AM - 10 AM): Highest outbound traffic
    Evening Peak (5 PM - 8 PM): Highest inbound traffic
    Most Congested Hours: 8 AM - 9 AM and 6 PM - 7 PM
    Least Traffic Hours: Midnight to early morning

Proposed Solutions for Traffic Optimization

    Staggered office timings and carpool incentives for peak days
    AI-based traffic signal adjustments during high congestion periods
    Digital entry systems and dedicated lanes for smoother access
    Infrastructure upgrades and smart monitoring for long-term efficiency

Challenges & Future Enhancements

    Lack of vehicle type segmentation – Data only includes cars
    No weather impact analysis – External factors like rain or roadwork not considered
    Implementation resistance – New traffic rules may face community pushback

Next Steps
Integrating real-time traffic monitoring, external factors, and pilot testing before enforcing large-scale changes.# Data-Analytics-sql-
